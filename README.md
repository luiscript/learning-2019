6. Random stuff

## Machine learning
I'm studyng a [machine learning for javascript](https://www.udemy.com/machine-learning-with-javascript/) course on Udemy. So far so good. I want to apply this on a private project for my company in the fintech industry to create a model that predicts if a client is a good candidate for a loan.
